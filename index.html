# Welcome to Senseable AI Lab.
"Senseable" is derived from the fusion of the words "sensible" and "-able", 
which embodies our focus on research and development of technologies or systems that rely on sensor data and information, such as vision, audio, text, and more.  <br>
Our lab not only focuses on AI algorithms but also utilizes advanced data analytics techniques to extract valuable insights.  <br>
Through big data analytics, we enable organizations to identify patterns, trends, and other meaningful information for informed decision-making and enhanced performance.  <br>
Our primary objective is to create innovative solutions and products that intersect technology, data, and human senses.  <br>

Specifically, our lab is dedicated to exploring the opportunities and challenges presented by sensing and analyzing urban and mobility environments.  <br>
By leveraging this knowledge, we aim to improve the quality of life, work, and transportation within cities.  <br>
Our research areas encompass mobility, energy, environment, and social behavior, with the ultimate goal of developing innovative solutions that contribute to sustainable and livable cities.<br>
  
We actively encourage talented individuals to join our team, including post-doctoral, master's, and Ph.D. students, as well as undergraduate interns. If you are interested in advancing your skills and making contributions to our research, we invite you to contact Professor Noh at senseable.ai@gmail.com for further information.
